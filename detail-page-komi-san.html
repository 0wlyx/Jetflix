                    <h3 class="main">Hitohito Tadano is an ordinary boy who heads into his first day of high school with a clear plan: to avoid trouble and do his best to blend in with others. Unfortunately, he fails right away when he takes the seat beside the school's madonna—Shouko Komi. His peers now recognize him as someone to eliminate for a chance to sit next to the most beautiful girl in class.
                        Gorgeous and graceful with long, dark hair, Komi is universally adored and immensely popular despite her mysterious persona. However, unbeknownst to everyone, she has crippling anxiety and a communication disorder which prevents her from wholeheartedly socializing with her classmates.
                        When left alone in the classroom, a chain of events forces Komi to interact with Tadano through writing on the blackboard, as if in a one-way conversation. Being the first person to realize she cannot communicate properly, Tadano picks up the chalk and begins to write as well. He eventually discovers that Komi's goal is to make one hundred friends during her time in high school. To this end, he decides to lend her a helping hand, thus also becoming her first-ever friend.

They have their first conversation, and Komi reveals her dream of making 100 friends. Tadano promises to help her find the other 99.

While walking Komi home, Najimi is approached by a delinquent named Maa who confesses his love. Komi's speech impediment and stare make Maa think she's an assassin, and he runs away. Najimi decides to be Komi's friend for real. They start having lunch together, making Tadano even more unpopular.

The same awkwardness occurs when she tries to ask Tadano for his number, with Agari accidentally ruining the moment. Komi is reluctantly elected class president but is instead voted class Goddess, with Tadano as president and Najimi as vice-president. Komi has an awkward first phone call with Tadano, which they both celebrate as an achievement. Komi is invited to play games with popular students, who let her win due to her popularity. Tadano sabotages the second game to spare Komi embarrassment, further adding to his unpopularity. However, Komi thanks him for helping her have fun.

                    <h1>At the festival, Najimi's shady tactics backfire, and they are forced to provide refunds. Komi, Tadano, and Najimi visit a haunted house and the rooftop confession area. Najimi is then dragged away by the meditation club, leaving Komi and Tadano to hang out with Onemine and Otori at the various stalls and activities. Komi's class is announced as winners of the festival, but due to Najimi's actions, they are not awarded the grand prize. At the dance party, Komi wishes to dance with Tadano, and they are joined by Najimi. After the festival, Komi's class goes to a karaoke bar where Komi receives praise for her singing despite being too nervous to actually perform. Tadano is motivated to sing when he sees Komi's support. Back at home, Komi cherishes the friendships she has made.</h1>
