                        <h2 class="line-clamp-5 synopsis-main">Corrupt politicians, frenzied nationalists, and other warmongering forces
                            constantly jeopardize the thin veneer of peace between neighboring countries Ostania and
                            Westalis. In spite of their plots, renowned spy and master of disguise "Twilight" fulfills
                            dangerous missions one after another in the hope that no child will have to experience the
                            horrors of war.

                            In the bustling Ostanian city of Berlint, Twilight dons the alias of "Loid Forger," an esteemed
                            psychiatrist. However, his true intention is to gather intelligence on prominent politician
                            Donovan Desmond, who only appears rarely in public at his sons' school: the prestigious Eden
                            Academy. Enlisting the help of unmarried city hall clerk Yor Briar to act as his wife and
                            adopting the curious six-year-old orphan Anya as his daughter, Loid enacts his master plan. He
                            will enroll Anya in Eden Academy, where Loid hopes she will excel and give him the opportunity
                            to meet Donovan without arousing suspicion.

                            Unfortunately for Loid, even a man of his talents has trouble playing the figure of a loving
                            father and husband. And just like Loid is hiding his true identity, Yor—who is an underground
                            assassin known as "Thorn Princess"—and Anya—an esper who can read people's minds—have no plans
                            to disclose their own secrets either. Although this picture-perfect family is founded on
                            deception, the Forgers gradually come to understand that the love they share for one another
                            trumps all else.</h2>

The high school girl directs Souta to a nearby ruin, but out of pure curiosity, she herself decides to head to the same destination.
                            Once there, Suzume discovers an isolated door with a dreamlike universe lying beyond it—a place that she can see and feel, but not enter. A strange stone rests on the ground nearby, but it turns into a cat-like creature and scurries away when Suzume lifts it. Suddenly afraid, she heads back toward her school, not realizing that her act of leaving the door open will have consequences.
                            With the "keystone" released, the evil within the other universe can now freely escape and wreak havoc throughout Japan. Intending to correct her dangerous mistake, Suzume joins Souta—whose true goal is to prevent evil from festering—in finding and locking all open doors before the country is destroyed.</h2>

Unfortunately, he fails right away when he takes the seat beside the school's madonna—Shouko Komi. His peers now recognize him as someone to eliminate for a chance to sit next to the most beautiful girl in class.
                            Gorgeous and graceful with long, dark hair, Komi is universally adored and immensely popular despite her mysterious persona. However, unbeknownst to everyone, she has crippling anxiety and a communication disorder which prevents her from wholeheartedly socializing with her classmates.
                            When left alone in the classroom, a chain of events forces Komi to interact with Tadano through writing on the blackboard, as if in a one-way conversation. Being the first person to realize she cannot communicate properly, Tadano picks up the chalk and begins to write as well. He eventually discovers that Komi's goal is to make one hundred friends during her time in high school. To this end, he decides to lend her a helping hand, thus also becoming her first-ever friend.</h2>

As the radio tower in Leidenschaftlich continues to be built, telephones will soon become more relevant, leading to a decline in demand for "Auto Memory Dolls." Even so, Violet Evergarden continues to rise in fame after her constant success with writing letters. However, sometimes the one thing you long for is the one thing that does not appear.
                            Violet Evergarden Movie follows Violet as she continues to comprehend the concept of emotion and the meaning of love. At the same time, she pursues a glimmer of hope that the man who once told her, "I love you," may still be alive even after the many years that have passed.</h2>

However, Maquia has always felt lonely despite being surrounded by her people, as she was orphaned from a young age. She daydreams about the outside world, but dares not travel from her home due to the warnings of the clan's chief.

                            One day however, the outside world finds her, as the power-hungry kingdom of Mezarte invades her homeland. They already have what is left of the giant dragons, the Renato, under their control, and now their king wishes to add the immortality of the Iorph to his bloodline.
                            
                            The humans and their Renato ravage the Iorph homeland and kill most of its inhabitants. Caught in the midst of the attack, Maquia is carried off by one of the Renato that has gone berserk. It soon dies, and she is left deserted in a forest far from home, now truly alone save for the cries of a single baby off in the distance. Maquia finds the baby in a destroyed village and decides to raise him as her own, naming him Ariel. Although she knows nothing of the human world, how to raise a child that ages much faster than her, or how to live with the smoldering loneliness inside, she is determined to make it all work somehow.</h2>
